  - Short response time
  - Integrated Temperature sensor

## Sensor Description
This gas sensor is designed to identify the presence of C2H6O in the atmosphere. It functions as a passive component that detects gas presence through variations in its internal resistance. The incorporation of tungsten trioxide nanoparticles alters the conductivity of the aluminum interdigitated combs based on the gas composition in contact with the sensor. An internal heater allows the sensor to reach temperatures of up to 250°C, enhancing the sensitivity of the nanoparticles and minimizing interference from ambient humidity. Additionally, the sensor features an aluminum resistor to monitor its temperature, enabling improved control and the potential for temperature autoregulation.
